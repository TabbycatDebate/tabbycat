msgid "Preshuffling doesn't compromise the optimality of position allocations: It simply shuffles the order in which teams and debates appear in the input to the algorithm, by randomly permuting the rows and columns of the position cost matrix. The Hungarian algorithm still guarantees an optimal position assignment, according to the chosen position cost function."
