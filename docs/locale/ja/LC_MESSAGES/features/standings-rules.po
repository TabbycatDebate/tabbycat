msgid "The test proceeds by `calculating the chi-squared stat, then running a series of tests <https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat/blob/develop/tabbycat/motions/statistics.py#L98>`_. The tests are where we go a little off-book with respect to statistical methodology. Normally we would test at a single \"level of significance\" (ie. with a certain degree of certainty), but that's insufficient in telling us how bad a motion ended up being. So, instead, we conduct a range of tests with a range of levels of significance, and calculate the minimum level of significance that causes our null hypothesis to be rejected. Using the minimum level of significance that rejects our null hypothesis, we can then grade the fairness of the motion on a scale. Motions whose tests fall below a certain threshold will be considered fair, while others will be graded based on the minimum."

The assumption here is that, during the time allotted for motion selection, teams estimate how appealing a motion is from their position, and then veto the topic that they feel is least favourable. Thus, the null hypothesis is that a motion that is perceived of as fair would be vetoed by affirmative and negative teams to an equal degree."
