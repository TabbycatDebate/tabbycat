msgid "First, it divides teams into \"raw brackets\", grouping them by the number of wins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/draw-generation.rst:71
msgid "Second, it resolves odd brackets, applying the odd brackets rule to make sure there is an even number of teams in each bracket. This is often called \"pulling up\" teams."

msgid "Third, within each bracket, it pairs teams into debates using the pairing method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/draw-generation.rst:73

msgid "Odd bracket resolution"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/draw-generation.rst:86
msgid "The **draw odd brackets** option specifies what you do when a bracket has an odd number of teams. (Obviously you have to do something, otherwise you can't pair off teams within the bracket.) There are two groups of methods: pull-up and intermediate brackets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/draw-generation.rst:90
msgid "**Pull-up methods** take one or more teams from the next bracket down, and move them into the odd bracket to fill the bracket."

You can choose to pull up the top team from the next bracket, or the bottom team, or the middle team, or a randomly chosen team.

msgid "If you're using conflict avoidance and intermediate brackets, you will probably want to use **Intermediate with bubble-up-bubble-down** instead. This uses the \"bubble-up-bubble-down\" rule to swap teams out of an intermediate bracket if there is a history or institution conflict.

If there aren't enough teams in the next bracket down, take teams from the bracket after that, and so on, until the (original) odd bracket is filled. Higher brackets are always filled first. You can choose to pull up the top teams from the next bracket, the bottom teams, or a random selection of teams."

In **Intermediate 1**, it will just take teams from the bracket after that, and so on, until the intermediate bracket is filled. In **Intermediate 2**, it will split the intermediate bracket: the teams that can be paired with the next bracket form the first intermediate bracket, and then the teams that aren't form a new (unfilled) intermediate bracket, to be filled from teams from the bracket after that. This keeps going, splitting into as many intermediate brackets as necessary, until all excess teams from the original odd bracket are paired."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/draw-generation.rst:130
msgid "**Balance** assigns the team that has affirmed less so far the affirmative side (and, therefore, the team that has negated less the negative side). If both teams have affirmed the same number of times, it assigns sides randomly."

msgid "Each swap obviously affects the debates around it, so it's not legal to have two adjacent swaps. (Otherwise, in theory, a team could \"one down\" all the way to the bottom of the draw!)
