msgid "If you need an offline copy of Tabbycat, installing using Docker should be simpler and quicker than using the \"Install Locally on…\" instructions for your operating system. However if a Docker installation doesn't work as outlined below, it's harder to address what isn't working. If you encounter any problems with Docker, we recommend using the \"Install Locally on…\" option as a fallback, but if you need to do so, `please also report the issue you're having on GitHub <https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat/issues/new?labels=installation-docker&title=Docker%20installation%20problem&body=Please%20be%20sure%20to%20include%20your%20operating%20system%20and%20version,%20and%20please%20be%20as%20specific%20as%20you%20can%20about%20the%20problem%20you%20encountered%3A%0D%0D>`_ or :ref:`contact the developers <authors>`."

msgid "Docker is an application that makes it very easy to load and run a specific collection of software. It allows us to bundle everything necessary to run Tabbycat into a single package rather than have users install everything needed step-by-step. Once set up, Docker will allow you to start and stop a webserver (that in turn runs Tabbycat) on your computer whenever you want and without the need for internet access."
