The long way requires some familiarity with command-line interfaces and Git, and requires a :ref:`local installation <install-local>` as a prerequisite, but makes it easier to :ref:`upgrade versions <upgrade-heroku>` later on and (unlike the short way) allows you to import data from CSV files."

You'll also have the flexibility to make and contribute updates to the source code.  We recommend it if you have experience with Git.
