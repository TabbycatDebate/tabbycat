While a background in the specific tools Tabbycat uses (Python, PostgreSQL, *etc.*) will make things easier, it's not necessary: we'll talk you through the rest. You just need to be prepared to bear with us. It'll take a while the first time, but it gets easier after that."

The easiest way to find it (on Windows 7 and later) is to search for it in your Start Menu. Every line in the instructions that begins with ``>`` is a command that you need to run in PowerShell, but without the ``>``: that sign is a convention used in instructions to make it clear that it is a command you need to run."
