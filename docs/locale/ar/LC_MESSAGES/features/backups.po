msgid "Tabbycat doesn't provide an in-built backup system; instead you should create copies of your database directly. Heroku provides a very good backup utility for all sites hosted on Heroku which makes this easy, and for Heroku-based Tabbycat sites, we strongly recommend it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/backups.rst:12
msgid "You should **always** back up the database before deleting *any* data while in the Edit Database area, because deleting data cannot be undone. It is also a good idea to back up the database before doing anything in the Edit Database area, unless you're very familiar and confident with editing the Tabbycat database directly."

#: ../../features/backups.rst:18
msgid "You may, as a matter of standard practice at large tournaments, wish to back up the database twice per round: Once just after you've generated the draw and allocated adjudicators, and once just after you've finished entering results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/backups.rst:22
msgid "If you're using an online version of Tabbycat, it's a good idea to download the backups. While it's extremely rare to lose internet access or have an outage in a critical web service (*i.e.*, Heroku), having a local copy of your backups allows you to :ref:`restore your tab to a local installation <backup-restore-to-local>` if this ever happens."

This might be useful if, say, your internet connection breaks irrecoverably in the middle of a tournament and you need to run offline. Of course, for this to work, you need to have downloaded your backup before your internet connection broke---a good reason to download a copy of your backups as soon as you make them."
