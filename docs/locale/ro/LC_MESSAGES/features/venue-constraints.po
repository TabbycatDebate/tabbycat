msgid "Tabbycat supports a basic form of venue constraints. A **venue constraint** is a requirement that a particular **team, adjudicator, institution** or **division** be assigned to a venue in a particular **venue category**.  Typical uses would include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/venue-constraints.rst:12
msgid "Meeting venue accessibility requirements of particular teams (*e.g.* step-free access)"

#: ../../features/venue-constraints.rst:15
msgid "Keeping all debates in a division in one location"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/venue-constraints.rst:17
msgid "Constraints apply to **venue categories**, not individual venues. That is, you specify that (say) a team should be given a venue from a particular *list* of venues. Of course, it's permissible for a venue category to have only one venue in it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/venue-constraints.rst:22
msgid "The algorithm used to satisfy venue constraints is not guaranteed to be optimal. In some rare cases, it may propose an allocation that fails some constraints, even though some other allocation would have satisfied all (or more) constraints. In almost all practical circumstances, however, it should work, and save human effort (and time) in specially allocating rooms."

msgid "Adding venue categories"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/venue-constraints.rst:31
msgid "Before you add venue constraints, you first need to add venue categories. Each venue category is a list of venues, typically satisfying a particular need. For example, you might have a category for each of the following:"

msgid "To add or edit venue categories, go to the **Import Data** area (under Setup) then select **Add/Edit Venue Categories**. Note that this page will show all existing Venue Categories first before showing the blank forms that allow you to create new categories. Give your category a name (like \"Step-free access\"), assign it some venues, then click the \"Save Venue Categories\" button at the bottom of the page."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/venue-constraints.rst:91
msgid "However, if you have one or more venue constraints for adjudicators, it's not possible to take adjudicator venue constraints into account during draw generation, because the adjudicator allocation isn't known then. You'll need to run the venue allocation yourself after you've allocated adjudicators."

msgid "To run venue allocation, go to **Edit Venues** (while looking at the draw), then in the screen where you can edit venues, click the **Auto Allocate** button.

msgid "It could just be one of those edge cases that's too hard for the naïve algorithm to handle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/venue-constraints.rst:113
msgid "Currently, Tabbycat doesn't tell you which of these happened, so if the venue allocation fails to meet all your constraints, it's on you to figure out why. In most scenarios, we imagine you'll have few enough constraints that this will be obvious; for example, if the chief adjudicator is judging a team with accessibility requirements, it might be obvious that the latter's constraint took priority. We might in future add support for more useful guidance on conflicting constraints, but we currently consider this to be of low priority."
