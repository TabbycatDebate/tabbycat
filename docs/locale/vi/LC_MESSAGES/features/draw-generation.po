msgid "First, it divides teams into \"raw brackets\", grouping them by the number of wins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/draw-generation.rst:71

msgid "The **draw odd brackets** option specifies what you do when a bracket has an odd number of teams. (Obviously you have to do something, otherwise you can't pair off teams within the bracket.) There are two groups of methods: pull-up and intermediate brackets."

You can choose to pull up the top team from the next bracket, or the bottom team, or the middle team, or a randomly chosen team.

msgid "If you're using conflict avoidance and intermediate brackets, you will probably want to use **Intermediate with bubble-up-bubble-down** instead.

In **Intermediate 2**, it will split the intermediate bracket: the teams that can be paired with the next bracket form the first intermediate bracket, and then the teams that aren't form a new (unfilled) intermediate bracket, to be filled from teams from the bracket after that. This keeps going, splitting into as many intermediate brackets as necessary, until all excess teams from the original odd bracket are paired."
