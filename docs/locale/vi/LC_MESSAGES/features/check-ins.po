msgid "A 'Check-in' is a record of a speaker, adjudicator, venue, or ballot's status at a particular point in time. Typically these are used at large tournaments to reliably track who is or is not present for the first round of each day."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:9
msgid "Check-ins serve a similar purpose to the :ref:`availability <availability>` system. However availabilities are tied to a particular round rather than to a particular time — they are generally used to record instances where you know ahead of time whether a person should or should not be included in a draw. In contrast, check-ins are useful for when you *don't* know ahead of time whether a person will be able to be put into the draw and so want to be able to confirm their presence with a high degree of confidence. That said the two systems interact — the standard availability pages allow you to easily set all adjudicators or teams who have checked-in as available for a given round."

msgid "Check-In Identifiers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:14
msgid "Check-ins are associated with a 'identifier' — a number that is unique to each speaker and adjudicator. To generate these numbers go to the *Identifiers* section under the Check-Ins menu. From here you generate identifiers for Speakers, Adjudicators, and Venues as needed. Note also that Identifiers can be manually added or edited in the *Edit Database* area if necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:18
msgid "Once this number has been generated it can be transformed into a barcode so that it can be easily included on tournament badges or otherwise printed and disbursed. On the same *Identifiers* page you can use the *View barcodes* option to open up a page that lists all the barcodes for the speakers, adjudicators, or venues."

msgid "On the *Scanning* section of Check-ins you can record a particular check-in. This can be done in a few different ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:29
msgid "You can type in the Identifier number into the box. Once five numbers have been identified it will automatically issue the check-in and clear the input field for the next number."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:31
msgid "If you have purchased barcode scanners and configured them as USB keyboards they should then be compatible with this page: upon page load the cursor should be positioned in the input field, and any scanned barcodes should populate it with the specified number, issue the check-in, and then clear the box for the next scan."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:33
msgid "Barcode scanners are probably cheaper than you think. A perfectly serviceable model should be around $20 USD or less although a cursory Google search might at first turn up models that are many times that amount. If you are a curious tab director, or are involved in a tournament with a little spare money, having just one or two around for critical tasks can be highly valuable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:35
msgid "If your device has a (web)cam you can use the Scan Using Camera button. Any barcodes put in front of the camera's video stream will be scanned into the form. A sound will play when a barcode has been identified — so be aware that turning sound on or using headphones can help identify when a scan has been made."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:39
msgid "Camera scanning works on most modern browsers although it will only work with Safari 11 or higher (iOS 11+ and macOS 10.13+). Camera scanning may also not work when using a local-installation of Tabbycat in all browsers, *except* Firefox where it seems to. Depending on the quality of your camera barcodes that are less than 4cm wide may not be recognised — ideally barcodes should be at least 5cm if using this method as your main way of checking-in things."

msgid "The Check-In 'Window'"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:46
msgid "Because Check-In events are not explicitly linked to rounds there is essentially a 'window' or time period in which a check-in is still considered valid. The time of this 'window' in hours can be set in *Setup* > *Configuration* > *Data Entry*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:48
msgid "At tournaments the run check-ins during the start of each day the check-in 'window' (i.e. the time before check-ins expire) you can leave this window setting at the default time (12 hours) which should give enough time to distinguish between the first check-ins of that day as compared to the last check-ins of the previous day. At tournaments where you want to run a check-in process at the start of every round you may want to set the time to around 2 hours or something much shorter."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/check-ins.rst:57
msgid "The blue \"tick\" boxes allow you to manually check-in people and/or entire institutions (for *People*) or venues and/or venue groups (for *Venues*) , without the need to scan their identifiers. This style of check-in is designed for use an auditorium roll-call type situation where you might be running through a list of people to the room or identifying absences on a per-institution basis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Venues can be checked-in, but what a 'venue check-in' means is a bit more flexible. It might be used to validate which rooms are debate-ready at the start of a day (i.e. unlocked; has a desk) or it could be used during the rounds to record which rooms have returned their ballots."
