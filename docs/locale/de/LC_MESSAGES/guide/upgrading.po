msgid "Assuming you haven't made any changes to the Tabbycat code, upgrading a locally installed copy should just be a matter of `downloading the latest source code <https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat/releases/latest>`_ and replacing the existing files with the new ones. If you used git to download these files initially you can just pull down the latest copy of the master branch to do this."
