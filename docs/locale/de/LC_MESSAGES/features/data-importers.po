msgid "The **tournament data importer** is the class that imports data from one or more files (usually CSV files) into the database. A base class ``BaseTournamentDataImporter`` is in `importer/base.py <https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat/blob/develop/importer/base.py>`_. An example of a data importer is in `importer/anorak.py <https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat/blob/develop/importer/anorak.py>`_."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:18
msgid "It's not possible to devise a single, universally-convenient import file format. Tabbycat supports way too many permutations of configurations for this to be workable. Instead, we provide the ones that have been useful before and are therefore likely to be useful again—but if your tournament has different needs, you might decide that it's easier to write an importer to conform to you, rather than conform to the importer."

msgid "A base importer class abstracts away most of the nitty-gritty of parsing files, allowing new importers to focus on their interpretation with as little code as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "To allow new importers to be written with as little code as possible, most of the work is abstracted to the base class. The flipside of this abstraction is that it induces a learning curve."

msgid "It's easiest to start with an example. Here's a basic importer with just one import method, which imports adjudicators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:60
msgid "Let's break this down. The method ``import_adjudicators()`` takes a single argument, a file object representing the CSV file. Most of the work is passed off to ``self._import()``. This helper method is defined in ``BaseTournamentDataImporter`` and is where most of the intelligence lies."

msgid "When called, ``self._import(f, model, interpreter)`` does the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:67
msgid "It reads the CSV file using a `csv.DictReader <https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader>`_. A ``DictReader`` iterates through the CSV file, yielding a dict for each line, whose keys are given by the column header names in the first row of the file."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:101
msgid "The main task of an importer, then, is to provide interpreters so that ``self._import`` knows how to interpret the data in a CSV file. An interpreter takes a dict and returns a dict. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:113
msgid "This interpreter does the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:115

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:122
msgid "Leaves all other entries in the dict unchanged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:124
msgid "This looks simple enough, but it's very robust. What if a cell in the CSV file is blank, or what if the file omits a column? (For example, some tournaments might not collect information about participant gender, so Tabbycat doesn't require it.) We could deal with these scenarios on a case-by-case basis, but that's cumbersome."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:130
msgid "Instead, we provide a ``make_interpreter`` method that returns an interpreter method which, in turn, takes care of all these details. This way, all you have to do is provide the functions that transform fields. So the following is equivalent to the above, but better:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:143
msgid "Notice that we provided a callable in two of these keyword arguments, and a (non-callable) Tournament object to the third. ``make_interpreter`` is smart enough to tell the difference, and treat them differently. What it does with each field depends on (a) whether a value exists in the CSV file and (b) what transformation function was provided, as summarised in the following table:"

msgid "You shouldn't check for mandatory fields. If a mandatory field is omitted, the model constructor will throw an error, and ``self._import()`` will catch the error and pass a useful message on to the caller. On the other hand, if it's an optional field in the model, it should optional in the importer, too. Similarly, interpreters generally shouldn't specify defaults; these should be left to model definitions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:180
msgid "You don't need to include interpreter transformations for things like converting strings to integers, floats or booleans. Django converts strings to appropriate values when it instantiates models. So, for example, adding ``test_score=float`` to the above interpreter would be redundant."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/data-importers.rst:205
