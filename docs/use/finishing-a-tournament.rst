Finishing a Tournament
======================

This page outlines some final steps to take after the conclusion of outrounds.

Tab Release
===========

Tabs can be released using the *Tab released* option under **Setup** > **Configuration**. Tabbycat offers the following system tabs:

- Team Tab
- Speakers Tab
- Replies Tab
- Motions Tab

You can configure the team, speakers and replies tab to display only a certain number of speakers, *e.g.*, to show only a "Top 10 Speakers" tab.

If you defined any speaker categories (for example, Novice, ESL or EFL), a tab for each category marked "public" can also be released using the **Release speaker category tabs to public**. You can similarly limit each of these tabs to display just the top few speakers, in the definition of the speaker categories. The speaker categories not marked public are *not* released by this option.

You can also redact individual speaker's identifying details (name, team, and institution) from the public individual tabs. You can do so by going into the **Edit Database** area, going to *Participants > Speakers*, finding the speaker and clicking the **Anonymous** box (and saving).

.. note:: Public tab pages are cached for performance reasons. This means that any changes that affect a tab page (say redacting a speaker or changing a speaker score) may not show up on the public site for up to an hour.

Wrapping Up
===========

You probably want to turn off the *Public ballots*, *Public feedback*, *Feedback progress*, and *Public draw* features under **Configuration** at this stage as they no longer have any use.

You also want to go into the **Edit Database** area, find the tournament and hit "release all" so that the results for the final round can be released.
