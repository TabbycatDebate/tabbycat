"""Pairing classes.

The pairing classes hold basic information about pairings for communication to
and from other modules.

Draw generators always return a list of pairings (`Pairing` for two-team formats,
`PolyPairing` for BP).

Draw generators that take results from the previous round, namely elimination
rounds after the first elimination round, expect to be given a list of pairings.
For this purpose, special "result pairing" classes should be used
(ResultPairing` for two-team formats, `BPEliminationResultPairing` for BP).
These classes add the ability to store the winning (two- team) or advancing (BP)
teams from the debate represented by the pairing.

As much as possible, these classes do not make database queries. Their intent is
to be a Python-only data structure, with a few smarts where convenient. The one
exception is the class method `.from_debate(debate)`, which is provided for
convenience for callers to construct a pairing (typically a result pairing)
from a `Debate` instance.
