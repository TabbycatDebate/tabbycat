    If there are allocated sides, use BasePowerPairedWithAllocatedSidesDrawGenerator

    Options:
        "odd_bracket" - Odd bracket resolution method. Permitted values:

            "pullup_top"    - Pull up the top team from the next bracket down.
            "pullup_bottom" - Pull up the bottom team from the next bracket down.
            "pullup_random" - Pull up a random team from the next bracket down.
            "intermediate"  - The bottom team from the odd bracket and the top
                              team from the next bracket down face each other in
                              an intermediate bracket.
            "intermediate_bubble_up_down" - Like "intermediate", but will swap
                              teams that conflict by history or institution.

            or a function taking a dict mapping floats to lists of Team-like
            objects, and operating on the dict in-place.

        "pullup_restriction" - Restriction on who can be pulled up. Permitted values:

            "none"             - No restriction.
            "least_to_date"    - Choose from teams who have been pulled up the
                                 least number of times in previous rounds.
            "lowest_ds_wins"   - Choose from teams who have the lowest draw strength by
                                 wins (indicative of having been against easier teams)
            "lowest_ds_speaks" - Choose from teams who have the lowest draw strength by
                                 speaks (indicative of having been against easier teams)
            "lowest_ds_rank"   - Choose from teams who have the lowest straw strength by
                                 rank (i.e. we sum up the rankings of all the previous
                                 opponents and pick the team with the lowest total score).

        "pairing_method" - How to pair teams. Permitted values:
            (best explained by example, these examples have a ten-team bracket)

            "slide"  - 1 vs 6, 2 vs 7, ..., 5 vs 10.
            "fold"   - 1 vs 10, 2 vs 9, ..., 5 vs 6.
            "random" - Pairs chosen randomly.

            or a function taking a dict mapping floats to even-length lists of
            Team-like objects, and returning a list of Pairing objects with
            those teams.

        "avoid_conflicts" - How to avoid conflicts. Permitted values:

            "off"             - Do not attempt to avoid conflicts.
            "one_up_one_down" - Swap conflicted teams with the debate above or
                                below, in accordance with Australasian
                                Intervarsity Debating Association rules.
            "graph"           - Find the minimum-cost matching in a generated
                                graph of the teams in a bracket.
