"""Scoresheet classes.

The scoresheet classes are responsible for storing a buffer of scores, and
computing basic results like the winners and margin for that scoresheet. They do
not interact with the database and have no concept of team identity---that is
the responsiblity of the debate result classes.

"Position", "side" and "team" take the same meanings as in result.py. However,
since the scoresheet classes don't know about team identities, the word "team"
should not appear in any of them.
