      We hope you've enjoyed using Tabbycat for your tournament. We would appreciate if you would
      make a donation to the project in order to support its ongoing development and maintenance.
      For a tournament of this size, we suggest a donation of <strong>${{ amount }}</strong>.
      Note that if your tournament is run for profit, or for fundraising, making this payment is a
      mandatory condition of Tabbycat's software license.

            The next step is to import your initial tournament data: the
            institutions, teams, adjudicators and rooms that are in your
            tournament. There are a number of ways to do this. For small-to-medium
            tournaments, the simple importer is your best bet.
