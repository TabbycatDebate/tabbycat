Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for 3 vs 3 debating tournaments. It was used at Auckland Australs 2010, [Victoria Australs 2012](https://www.facebook.com/Australs2012), [Otago Australs 2014](http://australs2014.herokuapp.com), [Daejeon Australs 2015](http://australs2015.herokuapp.com) and [many other tournaments of all sizes](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about/tournament-history.html).

Our **demo site** is at [tabbycatdebate.herokuapp.com](http://tabbycatdebate.herokuapp.com/). It's normally up, but its form will vary from time to time as we set up new feature demos for people. If it's down and you'd like to see it, or if you want to play with it as if you were running a tournament, [contact us](#authors-and-contacts). To see a post-tournament website, have a look at the [Daejeon Australs 2015 tab website](http://australs2015.herokuapp.com).

## Features

- Enter data from multiple computers simultaneously
- Easily deployable to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for a fast and free setup
- Automated adjudicator allocations based on adjudicator ranking, room importance, and conflicts
- A drag and drop interface for adjudicator allocation that automatically displays conflicts alongside gender and regional balance
- A fully responsive design that automatically adapts to suit large screens, laptops, tablets, and phones
- Configurable [draw generation rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/draw-generation.html) and [team standings rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/team-standings-rules.html)
- Confiugrable [adjudicator feedback questions](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/adjudicator-feedback.html) and optional online submission of feedback and scoresheets
- Optional online post-tournament tab display

Tabbycat is currently optimized for Australs, but we're developing for all two-team formats. So if your tournament has different requirements to what we have (say, different draw rules or number of speakers), odds are we've already thought about it and it's on the [to-do list](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues).

That said, our to-do list is long. **We prioritise our work by the features that will be used first.** So if you're planning to use it for a tournament but need some changes, please don't be shy—[get in touch with us](#authors-and-contacts) and we'll be more than happy to help. Please don't just wait for us to implement your requirement: we'd rather have the real-time feedback about which features are most useful!

## Installation and User Guide

Our user guide is at http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/.

If you'd like to run a tournament with Tabbycat but are not able to set it up, get in touch with [Philip](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01aItEbHtwnn1PzIPGGM9W8A==&c=XWljk2iGokfhziV2Rt4OiKA5uab1vCrnxwXcPUsWgnM=) and he can setup a private online copy of the software for your use.

## License and Development

We haven't released this under an open-source licence (so there is no formal general right to use this software), but if you're running a debating tournament, you're welcome to use it. It'd be nice if you could please let us know that you're doing so, and let us know how it went. [Our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) is a great place to start. We're happy to help if you have any questions or feature requests although we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability.

Pull requests are encouraged and if you're interested in helping out as a developer, we'd love to have you! [Join our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) and contact us as below.

If you have a GitHub account, we'd prefer that **bug reports** be submitted to our [issues page](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues). Otherwise, feel free to [shoot us an email](#authors-and-contacts).
